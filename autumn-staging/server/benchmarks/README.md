# âš¡ Autumn Server Benchmarks

Fast, reliable performance testing for Autumn's core operations using dry runs and realistic workloads.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Measures

**Customer Operations** - Core customer lifecycle performance
- Customer creation and setup
- Usage tracking (light and heavy workloads)  
- Multi-feature billing calculations
- Entitlement checks
- Batch processing

**Product & Billing** - Subscription and pricing workflows
- Free and paid plan signups
- Plan upgrades and downgrades
- Usage-based pricing calculations
- Team plan setups
- Bulk plan changes

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmarks (recommended)
bun run benchmark

# Run specific category
bun run benchmark customer
bun run benchmark attach

# Export results for analysis
bun run benchmark --export
```

## ðŸ“Š Understanding Results

- **ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰** Rankings by speed (fastest to slowest)
- **Green** = Fast (< 5ms) | **Yellow** = Medium (5-20ms) | **Red** = Slow (> 20ms)
- **ops/sec** = Operations per second throughput

### Example Output
```
[1] Customer Creation                    2.1ms
[2] Usage Tracking (Light)               1.8ms  
[3] Free Plan Signup                     3.2ms
ðŸ’¡ 12/14 operations under 5ms | Average: 3.1ms
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **50 iterations** per test with 5 warmup runs
- **Dry runs only** - no database mutations or external API calls
- **Realistic latency simulation** - mimics actual DB/Stripe response times
- **CPU work simulation** - represents complex calculations

Perfect for CI/CD performance monitoring and optimization work!
